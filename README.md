# Godot Engine 3.1 Showcase - Reimu In Mega Man Level Test

Here is a showcase of quick work on platformer 2D game made with Godot 3.1 engine.

At first I planned to create a rpg game mixed with platformer style. There are still rpg elements left in the game. As you can see: floating damage number(Label) that pops out from anyone taking damage which is easy to make in Godot, experience system with the helps of Curve2D for experience growth rate, item drops that can be defined in an Array containing Dictionaries, and many more. I decided to do a quick prototype of mega man style by adding a few enemies, custom sound and visual effects to the game as addons. Nothing else special as this is a work-in-progress game.

I started this project for about 4 months ago. Although I'm quite new to Godot and I'd say that the engine has a lot of features you can play around with, and is pretty easy to learn. It's also open source, which means it's completely free! You can download it here:
